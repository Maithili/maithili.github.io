I am a Robotics Ph.D. student with the Robot Autonomy and Interactive Learning (RAIL) lab advised by Professor Sonia Chernova, at GeorgiaTech. My research focuses on developing service robots that seamlessly integrate into users' daily lives, functioning as effective and proactive assistants over extended interactions. This involves anticipating assistive opportunities, and generalizing user preferences regarding mode of robot assistance and manner of task execution. I leverage unobtrusive observations of user behavior and limited interaction with the user to address proactivity and personalization. Ultimately, my goal is to build a robot system that can autonomously predict when and how to perform various helpful assistive actions, alleviating not only the users’ physical effort of performing tasks, but also their cognitive burden of managing tasks and ensuring that things get done.

I was selected to participate in RCAIS Doctoral Consortium, in 2024, HRI Pioneers workshop in 2023 and RPL Summer School, at KTH, Sweden in 2022. I also helped organize CoRL, 2023 and co-organized a workshop at HRI 2023. Through my PhD, I worked with Akshara Rai at Meta in 2024, and with Chandra Bhagavatula at Allen Institute of AI (AI2) in 2023. Prior to starting my PhD, I worked with Toyota Research Institute and Zenuity on mapping and localization for autonomous vehicles, and obtained my master’s degree at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, with Prof. Chad Jenkins.
