  I am a Robotics Ph.D. student at GeorgiaTech, advised by Prof. Sonia Chernova. The aim of my research is to address the longitudinal proactive assistance problem, which constitutes understanding user's routines and preferences, and anticipating assistive opportunities over an extended period of time (several minutes to hours). My work so far has introduced a novel formulation of the longitudinal proactive assistance problem as that of learning temporal patterns from sequential observations of user behavior in different forms, providing assistive actions by predicting future object movements, and actively seeking feedback to alleviate uncertainty.

  I spent the last summer doing an internship at Allen Institute of Artificial Intelligenge (AI2), and prior to my PhD, I was in the autonomous vehicles industry working with Toyota Research Institute on mapping, and with Zenuity on localization. Before that, I obtained my master's degree at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where I was advised by Prof. Chad Jenkins. I earned my undergraduate degree at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.
