  I am a Robotics Ph.D. student at GeorgiaTech, advised by Prof. Sonia Chernova. My research focuses on enabling proactivity in assistive robots, which requires them to understand human routines grounded in the physical environment, such that they can carry out assistive tasks without being asked. I formulated and contributed a solution to the longitudinal proactive assistance problem as spanning large spaces (such as a whole house), and longer time horizons (minutes to hours) over which the robot would predict user needs.

  Prior to this, I was in the autonomous vehicles industry working with Toyota Research Institute on mapping, and with Zenuity on localization. Before that, I obtained my master's degree at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where I was advised by Prof. Chad Jenkins. I earned my undergraduate degree at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.
