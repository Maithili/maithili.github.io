  I am a Robotics Ph.D. student with the Robot Autonomy and Interactive Learning (RAIL) lab advised by Professor Sonia Chernova, at GeorgiaTech. The aim of my research is to enable longitudinal robot assistants to integrate seamlessly into routine user lives without adding unecessary burden, through proactivity and personalization. This involves using unobtrusive observations combined with limited interaction to anticipate assistive opportunities, and generalize user preferences regarding mode of robot assistance and manner of task execution. Ultimately, the goal is to predict helpful assistive actions, when they should be done, and how the robot should assist with them, in order to align with the preferences of the user.

I was selected to participate in the RCAIS Doctoral Consortium, in 2024, HRI Pioneers workshop in 2023 and the RPL Summer School in 2022 at KTH, Sweden. Through my PhD, I spent a summer 2024 at Meta, with Akshara Rai, and summer 2023 at Allen Institute of AI (AI2), with Chandra Bhagavatula. Prior to starting my PhD, I have worked with Toyota Research Institute and Zenuity on mapping and localization for autonomous vehicles. Before that, I obtained my master's degree at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where I was advised by Prof. Chad Jenkins, and earned my undergraduate degree at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.
