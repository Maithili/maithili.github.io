  I am a Robotics Ph.D. student at GeorgiaTech, advised by Prof. Sonia Chernova. My overarching research goal is to bridge the semantic gap in household assistive robots to make them more effective in unstructured everyday environments.

  Prior to this, I worked with Toyota Research Institute on autonomous driving, specifically mapping. Before that, I obtained my master's degree at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and my undergraduate degree at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.
