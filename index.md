<p>
  I am a Robotics Ph.D. student with the Robot Autonomy and Interactive Learning (RAIL) lab advised by Professor Sonia Chernova, at GeorgiaTech. The aim of my research is to address the longitudinal proactive assistance problem, which involves understanding user routines and preferences, and anticipating assistive opportunities over an extended period of time. I seek to do so by leveraging unobtrusive observations of the user, grounded in their household environment, and limited active interaction to query the user. Ultimately, the goal is to predict helpful assistive actions, when they should be done, and how the robot should assist with them, in order to align with the preferences of the user.

I was selected to participate in the HRI Pioneers workshop in 2023 and the Robotics, Perception and Learning Summer School in 2022 at KTH, Sweden. Through my PhD, I spent a summer at FAIR labs at Meta, with Akshara Rai, and one at Allen Institute of AI (AI2), with Chandra Bhagavatula. Prior to starting my PhD, I have worked with Toyota Research Institute and Zenuity on mapping and localization for autonomous vehicles. Before that, I obtained my master's degree at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where I was advised by Prof. Chad Jenkins, and earned my undergraduate degree at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.
