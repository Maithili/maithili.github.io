    description: The goal achieve complex tasks using potential-based wayfields associated with each constituent atomic motion. A null-space subsumption architecture was used to execute multiple motions while ensuring that any action cannot negatively impact another that has a higher priority.

    description: This work proposes gradient descent on artificial potential fields as a steer function in RRT and it's variants. It is shown to provide superior obstacle clearance with no compromise on the runtime performance against straight-line steer on RRT, RRT-connect and RRT*.
