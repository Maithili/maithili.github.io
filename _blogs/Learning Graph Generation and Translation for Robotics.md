Graphs have been a widely adopted way of representing ideas, physical systems and ... The field of robotics has seen graphs representing many different things, and has various tools to reason over them including probabilistic graphs and graph neural networks. 

Point cloud --> Scene Objects + Robot --> All household + robot? AND Conceptual knowledge bases.

Being a mechanical engineer, this idea of drawing boxes and joining them with lines and arrows is familiar terrain. However the ways you can use that representation are a plenty. Mechanical engineering tuaght me to add math from analytical models on these boxes and arrows, and shortly after Robotics taught me how the math did not have to be all deterministically known, and I learnt to add probabilistic models on graphical representations. Further, I learned that how the models themselves could be learned from data and I was introduced to the world of Graph Neural Networks. It is fascinating how graphical structures can represent such a variety of things, and allow a wide variety of tools to reason about them.

Graphs have been used as a versatile tool to represent many complex relations in AI and Robotics, like social networks, spatial maps, knowledge bases, molecules, etc. As a result of its vast but varied application, many different tools have been developed to generate and carry out inference over these structures. 

Today I wanted to talk about the applicability of these in the context of semantic robotics. We will scope semantics here to mean the understanding of objects and activities beyond labels.
